        <h2>Why Should I Donate Blood?</h2>
        <p class="text">Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person – the gift of life.A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components – red cells, platelets and plasma – which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions. Regular blood donation helps maintain healthy iron levels in the body, reducing the risk of conditions like hemochromatosis. It can also serve as a health check, as each donated unit undergoes rigorous testing for infectious diseases, ensuring the donor's well-being.
